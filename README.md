 Energy is increasingly becoming a scarce resource. Hence, our solution involves using Artificial Intelligence/Deep Learning models to solve the efficiency of Singapore's overall power grid output. We use a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to predict solar energy power production in India's power plants. Optimizing our model provides us with the ability to forecast future solar power improving the management of power grid balancing, planning and optimization. Knowing the exact amount of power coming from solar also allows Singapore's grid to burn less natural gas for power and lower carbon emissions. Hence, the forecast of solar energy generation is vital for today's smart grid.

# Overview
a. Exploratory Data Analysis 
(Dataset obtained from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anikannal/solar-power-generation-data)

    1. Data Preprocessing: constitutes preprocessing datetime variables in datasets and removing mismatching data between datasets

    2. Data Visualization for both power and weather datasets

    3.We use variables such as module temperature, ambient temperature and irradiation to predict AC Power generated from the solar cells

b. Our Model:
